=head1 CPANMetaDB

This is Zak's Perlish rewrite of Tatsuhiko Miyagawa's CPAN Meta DB,
hosted at Google AppEngine (http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com).  This exists
mostly as a personal exercise to use Perl and Mojolicious, and for
testing on cloud environments such as DotCloud.

See it live (soon) at http://cpanmetadb.zakame.net
